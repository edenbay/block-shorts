A Youtube shorts blocker which blocks all signs of the "shorts" function on Youtube.
Meant to be a fun learning project and to help others to stop watching short-length content.

Currently all shorts carousels on the homepage disappear as you scroll, the subscriptions page requires a refresh.

The side-bar shorts icon is removed from all pages.

The shorts option in the hamburger menu is going to be removed next.

Finally all /shorts/ endpoints will be blocked or redirected.
